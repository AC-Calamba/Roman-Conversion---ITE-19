This program reads arithmetic expressions involving Roman numerals from an input file (`input.txt`), performs the specified operations (addition, subtraction, or multiplication), and outputs the results in both decimal and word formats to an output file (`output.txt`). The key steps include:

1. Converting Roman numerals to decimal values.
2. Performing the specified arithmetic operation on the two operands.
3. Converting the result back to words.
4. Storing the formatted results in the output file.

The program supports operations between two Roman numerals (e.g., "M + MM") and handles the conversion of numbers to their English word equivalents (e.g., "3000" to "Three Thousand"). The input and output are handled through files for easy processing of multiple expressions.

CodeBlocks is used to compile the code.
